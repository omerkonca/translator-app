1
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,889
Once again, I am free to smite the world...

2
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:05,559
...as I did in days long past.

3
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:10,197
When the evil shape-shifting wizard, Aku,
arose from the bowels of hate...

4
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:14,768
...to ravage our homeland,
I was a young emperor at the time...

5
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,504
...and was helpless against his powers.

6
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,509
But I remembered our grandfather's
grandfather's story of three monks...

7
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,312
...who were gifted with mystical powers.

8
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,549
I rode to the highest peak
of the mountainside...

9
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:34,988
...where the monks agreed to forge me
an enchanted sword with great magic.

10
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:40,894
Armed with the sword and the hope of my
people, I plunged into battle against Aku.

11
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:45,032
His evil was no match for the power
of righteousness.
